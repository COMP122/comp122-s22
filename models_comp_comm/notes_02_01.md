## Review from Last-time
   1. Talked about how the file system was mapped
      - It's a tree,
      - top of the tree is called the root '/'
      - notation to my home directory: ~
      - hidden files: files that begin with a '.', e.g. .git, .ssh, 
      - to see hidden files:  ls -a
      - special files:  
          - '.'  : current directory
          - '..' : parent directory
   1. Relative and Absolute Naming, with the path when needed
   1. Internal of git
      - local repo stored in a .git directory
   1. ssh command and generating ssh keys
      - two keys: 1 public and 1 private
   1. Triangle to represent my current repository..  
      - you have cd into that triagle for any of your git commands to work approriate
   1. git remote -v
      - use to determine what your current remote repo is located
