# COMP 122/L Virtual Group Discussion Sessions with Sarah


* What is it?  

Group Discussion Sessions are designed to help strengthen your skills and help you succeed in your course.  
 
* What to expect?  

Each week your group leader will prepare different examples and problems to discuss at the meetings. The topics will change every week, but will align with ones you are covering in class. At each session you will have the opportunity discuss and collaborate with other students taking the same course.  
 
* How to attend?  

Below you will find your discussion leader's schedule. Each session will run for 1.5 to 2 hours, but you don't have to stay the entire time. You are also more than welcome to attend more than one session each week.
