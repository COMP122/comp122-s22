  1. Assignment on Checksum

  1. Assumptions:
     -  42    // x = 42
     -  0x2A  // x = 0x2A
     -  052 
     -  ``*``
     -  2#00101010:  
        -  0010 1010 == 0x 2A
        -  00 101 010 == 052

     - base 10: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
     - base 8:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
     - base 16: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
     - base 8: 07 + 01 = 10
     - base 10; 10 :  |||| |||| || 
     - base 08; 10 :  |||| ||||
     - base 16; 10 :  |||| |||| |||| ||||
